This is a drive security wipe application implemented in C#. It allows the free space of a drive to be wiped as well as a low level drive wipe using several different methods (1 pass, DoD, etc). This drive wiping application aims to allow for many advanced options but also provide a Windows version that is user friendly and can easily be used by a non-advanced windows user who may wish to wipe a USB or thumb drive.

This application has been tested against various USB hard disk drives as well as USB and eSATA drives. So far it has worked correctly but is still in ALPHA stage. Please use this application at your own risk - we assume no responsibility for lost data.

The source code is up and available for all the download.  Be sure and check back often since I have a lot of free time and check in code several times a day!
